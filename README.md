Ajo 🌍
Bringing Africa’s Trusted Savings Circles Onchain
Ajo is a decentralized community savings and payout platform built on Hedera, designed to bring Africa’s age-old group savings system — known as Ajo, Esusu, Stokvel, or Chama — into the digital age.
It enables trusted circles to automate contributions, payouts, and transparency using smart contracts.

🚀 Overview
Across Africa, millions of people rely on informal savings groups to pool money and support one another.
While these systems foster trust and cooperation, they often face problems like missed payments, fraud, and lack of transparency.

Ajo solves this by putting savings groups onchain.
Funds are managed by smart contracts — not people — ensuring automation, transparency, and fairness for everyone.

💡 Key Features
🔐 Onchain Trust
Every group is governed by a smart contract escrow.
No central collector. No manual records. Just code enforcing group rules.

⚡ Automated Contributions & Payouts
Contributions and payouts happen automatically on schedule — no delays, no disputes.

📊 Transparent Tracking
Every transaction is verifiable onchain, ensuring full visibility for all group members.

💰 Flexible Savings Modes
Rotational Mode – Members take turns receiving payouts.
Target Pool Mode – Groups save toward a shared goal.
Flexible Pool Mode – Members deposit anytime and optionally earn yield through DeFi integrations.
📈 Optional Yield Generation
Idle funds can be staked via Base DeFi protocols (like Aave) to generate passive income for members.

🌐 Accessibility
Supports multiple wallets and will integrate zkLogin for social/email onboarding.

🪙 Current Setup
For now, Ajo uses a mock USDT token for contributions and payouts:
NEXT_PUBLIC_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x04F9CE8FDba78e489D2dF705c3498736EfBa6D28

🧩 Why Onchain?
Ajo is built onchain to solve trust and transparency issues in traditional savings systems.

Smart contracts manage funds safely and automatically.
Transparency ensures every member can verify group activity.
Global participation allows members anywhere to join and contribute.
We’re not eliminating traditional savings circles — we’re redefining them and onboarding communities into a secure, inclusive, and borderless financial system.

🧠 Challenges
During development, we ran into:

State management issues when trying to display groups for a newly added member.
Mock token limitations while testing payment flows.
Time constraints, which limited some UI and integration polish.
These will be improved as we continue to refine the project.
